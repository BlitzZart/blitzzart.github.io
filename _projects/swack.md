Swack is a naive swarm behavior implementation. A quick proof of concept of an idea how a force based swarm simulation could work.

The WebGL box beneath shows an early stage of the project. You can control the swarm by moving around the attractor and manipulate the camera perspective.
The frame rate drops you may experience does not occur in the desktop application.

### Controls
*Move attractor/swarm:* "Arrow Keys", hold "Shift" for altitude

*Toggle debug visualization:* "R,T"

*Toggle camera (free/fixed):* "Space"

*Free camera controls:* "W,A,S,D" and "Mouse + Mouse keys"

*Locked camera controls:* zoom with "W,S" and pivot with "A,D"

*Load entity sets (UAVs):* "1,2,3,4,5,6,7"

*Load with fixed height (UGVs):* Hold "Shift" 

*Toggle fixed height on the fly:* "Return"

*Toggle UI:* "Escape"

*Have fun! :)*
