One of my main tasks was to develop the software for a laboratory study.

The experiment requires two PCs set up in two different rooms.
Each PC was connected to an eye tracking device ([Tobii EyeX](http://www.tobii.com/xperience/})).
While the game is installed on the first PC (player-PC) only, the second one (spectator-PC) exclusively
serves as a tracking data provider. Both screens are connected to the player-PC.
The application installed on the spectator-PC connects to the player-PC and starts sending eye tracking data.

Generally described, this work investigates shared gaze integrations in games and their effects on the social presence perceived by different roles (players and spectators) in a remote scenario.

## Focus and Tasks
