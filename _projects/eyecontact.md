One of my main tasks was to develop the software for a laboratory study.

The experiment requiresd two PCs set up in two different rooms.
Each PC was connected to an eye tracking device ([Tobii EyeX](http://www.tobii.com/xperience/})).
While the game was installed on the first PC (player-PC) only, the second one (spectator-PC) exclusively
served as a tracking data provider. Both screens were connected to the player-PC.
The application installed on the spectator-PC connected to the player-PC and started sending eye tracking data.

Generaly descibed, this work  investigates shared gaze integrations (constant gaze and eye contact) in games and their effects on the social presence perceived by different roles (players and spectators) in a remote scenario.
