Make 3D models reactive to music or approximation - or both. This mesh deformation plugin is created to allow exactly that in an easy way. 

The two main features of this asset are:

-- *Music Visualization.* Easily use music to animate several or all 3d objects in your project.

-- *Deformation based on the proximity of an object.* Imagine a first-person game - when the player comes close to a wall, statue or any other object, it starts wobbling.

It comes with one test audio clip and a couple of tools - tiny scripts.
