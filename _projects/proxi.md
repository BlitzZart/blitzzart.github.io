The idea of Proxi is to increase the degree of tele-presence in video conferencing and enable chats with larger amounts of people in one conference talk to each other without the common problem (of classical platforms as Skype or Zoom), that usually only one participant can talk and the rest has to listen.

When the idea was born and I started the project, I could not find existing equivalents online. Well now there are some well done Products out there already. This is why, Proxi might remain in its current state.

Currently Proxi is running on a server with a low bandwith internet connection - only for testing purpose.
