The projects idea targets on co-located settings,
where multiple users share both the virtual and the real space. The way how avatars
are visualized strongly influences their perception and therefore the feeling of presence.
The goal of the thesis was to develop a modular tracking and animation system
for VR environments, which should reveal further insights within this domain.

The aim of this thesis was the validation of the capabilities of a custom foot tracking
system as a data source for avatar animation in VR. It should be clarified to what
extent it is possible and reasonable to utilize a floor-based 2D foot tracking system to
control users’ avatar walking animations. Furthermore, it was explored if and how
such an approach can be utilized to foster the social presence in a co-located virtual
environment. Additionally, the performance of the 2D implementation was compared
to a state-of-the-art 6DoF tracking system.
