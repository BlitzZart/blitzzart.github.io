HIVE21 is a squad-based real-time strategy game set in the near future where intelligent life forms have invaded earth.
The intruders quickly set up organic bases, the HIVEs, from where they launch and coordinate their operations.
During the first weeks of contact human counter operations were quite effective, but then HIVE21 emerged,
apparently the most powerful one, and things quickly went south. Now, most of human population is eradicated or scattered.
Find and destroy HIVE21 and save the earth!
