Q-Balls is a networked visual programming installation, which requires the user... to throw balls on a wall xD. Utilizing a regular webcam, an application sends the hit positions over the network. A second application renders on two different screens (projector, and tv) and uses the received positions to generate the bot-program, visually as well as generating valid source code.
