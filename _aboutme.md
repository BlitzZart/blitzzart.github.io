Itâ€™s a me - Daniel. 

During the bachelor's degree programme, I started to develop the passion for creating games. Since back then my fascination is unbroken and I constantly work on game projects. During the master's degree programme, I worked in a research department in which I could gain expertise in game development and game design ... and satisfy my preference xD. Besides that, I have got experience in level design, sound design and more. The [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) on this website are an excerpt, which should provide an overview.
