Itâ€™s a me - Daniel.

About four and a half years ago, I started to develop the passion for creating games. Since back then my fascination is unbroken and I constantly work on game projects. During the master's degree programme, I worked in a research department in which I could gain expertise in game development and game design. Besides that, I have got experience in level design, sound design and more. The [projects]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/) on this website are an excerpt, which should provide an overview of my work.
Simply [contact]({{site.baseurl}}/contact/) me if you have any questions.
